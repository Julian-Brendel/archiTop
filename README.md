# archiTop
Archidekt to TableTop export cli
---
This project aims to smoothen the export process from a constructed [Magic the Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/en) card deck in [Archidekt](https://archidekt.com/) to the game [TableTop Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/286160/Tabletop_Simulator/).

## Motivation
Currently, third third party tools do exist to aid with this process, but these are neither smooth to use 
nor do they fulfill all the features that would smoothen the magic experience.

The two most noteworthy alternatives are:

1. **[Frogtown](https://www.frogtown.me/)** 
    - Doesn't allow to import directly from tabletop, requiring user to export and import
    - Doesn't keep track of the card versions used in the deck (basic lands will update to the most recent) 
    - Usage is slow, two step process required to generate and download deck
    - Doesn't separate commander cards from main deck
    
2. **[Tabletop scryfall importer](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1838051922)**
    - Unexpected behaviour when multiple people import at the same time
    - Doesn't include tokens in the exported deck
    - Doesn't separate commander cards from main deck 

## What does this tool do?
This tool converts an Archidekt deck into Tabletop Simulator json format, able to be imported onto any tabletop board.
The cards contained, deck-name and thumbnail will be extracted for given Archidekt deck-id. 

## Installation
The package is being hosted in PyPy, install using
`pip install architop`

## Usage
The tool is used via the commandline, runnable with
`architop <deckID>`

Additional usage information can be acquired via the help command
`architop -h`

## Example Usage
Let's take one of my decks as example.
Exporting the deck https://archidekt.com/decks/94674#Maximum_Borkdrive is as simple as copying the deck-id `94674`.

By running the tool with the given deck-id:  
`archiDekt 94674`, archiTop will export the deck as TableTop Simulator compatible file, alongside the thumbnail used for the deck in Archidekt.

Both files created will be named accordingly to the deck name in Archidekt:
![Output Example](https://archi-top.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/architop-output-example.png)

Now all that's left to do is to move the two files into the TableTop Objects folder.
The directory can vary for your Tabletop installation, based on OS.

You can find the path via the Tabletop Simulator game configurations:
![Tabletop Objects](https://archi-top.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/tabletop-save-location.png)


## Use of altered cards
You can optionally configure the tool to load alternate art versions of cards, by executing architop with the `-a` option:  
`architop <deckId> -a <path to .json file>`

The altered art json file, follows the format below:
```json
example_altered_cards.json
{
  "Pyroblast": "https://architop-altered.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Pyroblast.png",
  "Red Elemental Blast": "https://architop-altered.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Red+Elemental+Blast.png",
  "Aetherflux Reservoir": "https://architop-altered.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Aetherflux+Reservoir.png",
  "Chaos Warp": "https://architop-altered.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Chaos+Warp.png",
  "Dockside Extortionist": "https://architop-altered.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Dockside+Extortionist.png",
  "Sol Ring": "https://architop-altered.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Sol+Ring.png"
}
```


Have fun playing ðŸŽ‰
